Workplace ethics refer to the moral principles and values that guide behavior in the workplace. These principles help determine what is right or wrong, fair or unfair, and appropriate or inappropriate in a professional setting. They include honesty, integrity, respect, responsibility, fairness, and accountability.

Myths about Business Ethics:
1. Myth: Business Ethics is Optional - Some believe that ethics are secondary to profitability, but in reality, ethical behavior is fundamental for sustainable business success.
2. Myth: Ethical Companies Always Finish Last - Contrary to this belief, businesses that prioritize ethics often build stronger relationships with customers, employees, and stakeholders, leading to long-term success.
3. Myth: Business Ethics is Only About Avoiding Legal Issues - While legal compliance is important, ethics go beyond legal requirements, focusing on moral principles and societal expectations.

Importance of exercising workplace ethics:
1. Builds Trust: Ethical behavior fosters trust among employees, customers, and stakeholders, creating a positive work environment.
2. Enhances Reputation: Companies known for their ethical practices attract and retain customers and investors, leading to sustained growth.
3. Promotes Good Decision-Making: Ethical guidelines help employees make sound decisions, ensuring that actions align with the company's values and objectives.

Business Needs:
Business needs are the requirements or objectives that a business aims to fulfill to achieve its goals. Tasks related to business needs include:
1. Identifying market opportunities
2. Developing products or services
3. Establishing marketing and sales strategies
4. Managing finances and resources
5. Ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty

Feasibility analysis in software projects is crucial because it:
1. Assesses Technical Viability: Determines if the project can be realistically implemented with the available technology and resources.
2. Evaluates Economic Feasibility: Examines whether the project is financially viable and can generate sufficient returns on investment.
3. Considers Organizational Feasibility: Analyzes if the project aligns with the organization's capabilities, goals, and culture.

Definitions:
- Project Scope: The detailed description of the project's objectives, deliverables, timelines, and resources required to accomplish them.
- Solution Scope: The specific features, functionalities, and outcomes expected from the project to address the identified business needs.
- Checklist for Verifying Solution Scope: A structured list of criteria used to ensure that the proposed solution meets the defined requirements and expectations.

Project Implementation Alternatives:
1. Waterfall Methodology: A linear approach where each phase of the project is completed sequentially, from planning to implementation.
2. Agile Methodology: An iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle.
3. Hybrid Approach: Combining elements of both waterfall and agile methodologies to tailor the implementation process according to project requirements and constraints.
